# COS30049-Computing Technology Innovation Project Assignment - Front-end Development

The purpose of this assignment is to design and implement front-end web pages through analyzing the requirements of the project under a specific domain. This assignment is the first phase of the entire project. Students are supposed to acquire the following skills from the assignment:

1. Analyzing project requirements and translating them into practical web page designs
2. Proficiency in front-end web development (static website)
3. Gaining hands-on experience in working with cutting-edge technologies within the a specific domain (e.g., Blockchain and Web 3.0)
4. Collaborating effectively as a team to achieve project goals in the first phase of the overall development process

## Project Description
The project description provides an overview of the background and essential requirements for three different projects: 
1. smart contract audit system 
2. decentralized trading system and 
3. blockchain transaction information visualization system

Students are supposed to validate the project requirements with their clients (workshop tutors). Students should collaboratively discuss in their group and transform these requirements into corresponding documentation and practical code functions. Additionally, students have the opportunity to propose and integrate further enhancements into the system, which can be reflected in the final design.

The Blockchain Transaction Information Visualization System aims to provide an interactive and intuitive platform for visualizing and exploring blockchain transaction data. The system's primary goal is to present complex blockchain information in a user-friendly manner, enabling users to gain valuable insights into transaction patterns, network activity, and smart contract interactions.

## Core Functional Requirements

1. Users can input a wallet address in the search bar to retrieve basic information about the address. The website will display details such as the wallet's balance and other relevant data related to the address.
2. Upon searching for a wallet address, the system will display a directed graph, where each node represents a wallet address, and each edge represents a transaction between connected addresses.
3. Users can interact with the graph and explore the next/previous hop of connected addresses (e.g., clicking on nodes to explore further transaction paths)
4. The website will present relevant detailed transaction information in a tabular format.
5. All transaction data needs to be stored in a graph database for efficient retrieval and visualization.
